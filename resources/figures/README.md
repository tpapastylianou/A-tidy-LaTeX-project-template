Place all your figures here.

If possible, use the same filename for your figure file as the reference label
used in your text.

As an example, if you have an image file called "duckbunny.png", you
would probably refer to it in your main latex file like so:

    \begin{figure}[h]
      \centering
      \includegraphics{resources/figures/duckbunny}
      \caption{A duck. Or is it a bunny?}
      \label{fig:duckbunny}
    \end{figure}
