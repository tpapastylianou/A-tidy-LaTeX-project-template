Working with, and compiling LaTeX documents can get very messy. Most people
tend to dump all their files in a single folder, which then gets even more
messy as the pdflatex command generates a variety of intermediate files
required by the pdflatex compiler.

This project template separates the various components of a latex project
into their respective folders in a tidy manner, while also providing an
example compilation script (for bash-supporting systems) that can compile
everything as appropriate and then clean up any intermediate files.

Each folder contains an example file and a README.md file containing
information on how to use that folder. Feel free to explore.

The `main.tex` document shows an example document showing how to format your
latex document to make the best use of this template.
