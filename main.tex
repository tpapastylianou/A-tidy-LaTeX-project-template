\title { A tidy latex project template }

  \begin{abstract}
    This is an example document which makes use of the tidy latex project template.
  \end{abstract}

  \section{Introduction}

    Working with, and compiling \LaTeX documents can get very messy. Most people tend to dump all their files in a single folder, which then gets even more messy as the pdflatex command generates a variety of intermediate files required by the pdflatex compiler.

    This project template separates the various components of a latex project into their respective folders in a tidy manner, while also providing an example compilation script (for bash-supporting systems) that can compile everything as appropriate and then clean up any intermediate files.

    Each folder contains an example file and a README.md file containing information on how to use that folder. Feel free to explore.

  \section{Example use}

    This short sample document contains examples of how one might use this template, to link to externally defined equations, tables and figures.
    
    \subsection{ Equations }

      Display equations, by creating an 'equation' environment in this main document, and within it, redirect to the relevant equation file
      containing only the actual definition of your mathematical equation:

      \begin{equation}
         \label{eq:ExampeEquation}
         \input{resources/equations/ExampleEquation}
      \end{equation}

    \subsection{ Figures }

      Display figures by creating your 'floating' environment (e.g. via the graphicx package's includefigure command), and importing your figure file directly within it:

      \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{resources/figures/duckbunny}
        \caption{A duck. Or is it a bunny?}
        \label{fig:duckbunny}
      \end{figure}

    \subsection{ Tables }

      Place tables in your document by creating your 'table' environment, and importing your table file (a normal .tex file containing a 'tabular' definition) directly within:

    \begin{table}[h]
      \caption{An example table}
      \centering
      \input{resources/tables/ExampleTable}
      \label{tab:ExampleTable}
    \end{table}

    \subsection{ Bibliography and Citations }

      Use citations as normal (\cite{Papastylianou2021}). Link to your bibliography file(s) directly in the bibliography section.
